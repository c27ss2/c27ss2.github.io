<h1>September 26, 2023</h1>
	<p>Today I learned how to make and customize my person card. I made mine a picture of steph curry and then when you hover over it it is a gif of him.</p>

<h1>October 17, 2023</h1>
	<p> Today I worked on refining my website a little more. I added Mars and Earth to my homepage. </p>

<h1>January 9, 2024</h1>
	<p>Today we learned how to do more event listeners by using functions click and mousemove to make divs change</p>

<h1>February 22, 2024</h1>
	<p>Today we learned a bit about color theory and then made projects where using an event listener when we clicked the red green and blue values changed, forming a random color. Now I am beginning to make sliders for red green and blue so that the user can toggle the color and change the background color intentionally.</p>

<h1>February 29, 2024 - Quarter Review</h1>
	<p>This quarter I made several projects using the coding functions we learned.</p>

	<p>The first project I made was my face project, which allows the user to use eyes, nose, and mouth to customize a face. This code uses event listeners to both recognize which feature the user clicks on, and then using a click event listener to place down the feature on the face my making a div at the place the mouse clicked. Next quarter, I want to enhance this code a bit more just by adding more choices for features.</p>

	<p>The next project I worked on was my slot-machine. This used the array function in order to randomize the div chosen as a click. There is an event listener on the handle where when it is clicked, 3 random numbers 1-6 are chosen. These numbers correspond to divs, the individual slots, and the goal is to get the same thing on all three, getting a match. What I would add to this is fixing the slot handle so that it moves down when clicked and then flicks back up. I also think it would be cool to add a betting system where the user could wager some cash on the slot machine, just like in a real casino.</p>

	<p>Next I made a car project using a div of a car which moves with arrow keys. This uses keypress event listeners on the arrow keys to move the car and also rotates it depending on which arrow is clicked. I want to add to this project to make it into a game by making it so that the car can only be on the road and let the user toggle using up and down to move between the lanes. I am also going to add random boulders from the right which will "crush" the car if they come into contact. The user will have to dodge the boulders by switching lanes.</p>

	<p>Also one class when we were playing around with ChatGPT I used it to make a tic tac toe game.</p>
